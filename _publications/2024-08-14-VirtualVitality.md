**Overview:**
This project aims to enhance glaucoma diagnosis using an expert knowledge-distilled Vision Transformer, providing AI-augmented insights to ophthalmologists. The system integrates deep learning with medical imaging to focus on key diagnostic features in retinal images. By interactively highlighting areas of interest, the platform facilitates a more nuanced diagnosis process, aiming to support clinical decision-making.






**Key Features:**
- **Expert Model:** Focuses on critical diagnostic features in retinal images using a Vision Transformer distilled with expert knowledge.
- **Augmented Insights:** Highlights areas of interest for ophthalmologists, aiding in the detection and diagnosis of glaucoma.
- **User Study:** Conducted a user study with 15 ophthalmologists to validate the system's utility and effectiveness in a clinical setting.


**My Contributions:**
- **Leadership:** Spearheaded the development of both the front-end and back-end systems, ensuring seamless integration of AI and user interfaces.
- **User Study:** Designed and conducted the user study with 15 ophthalmologists, gathering feedback to improve the system's usability and diagnostic performance.
- **Experimentation:** Fine-tuned the interaction design to support clinicians effectively, focusing on enhancing decision-making processes in glaucoma diagnosis.


**Significance:**
This project demonstrates how AI can support clinical decision-making, specifically targeting glaucoma diagnosis. By combining expert knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques, the system aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, thereby contributing to better patient outcomes.




**Additional Notes:**
Detailed insights into this project can be found in my Master's thesis. The paper is currently under review for CHI 2025.
