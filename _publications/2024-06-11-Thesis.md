## PhysioLabXR: A Python Platform for Real-Time, Multi-Modal Brain–Computer Interfaces and Extended Reality Experiments


## Overview

This master's thesis encompasses three pioneering projects that explore the intersection of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), human-computer interaction (HCI), and extended reality (XR). The first project, **PhysioLabXR**, introduces an open-source software platform designed for real-time, multi-modal physiological data processing in neuroscience and HCI experiments. The second project, **Interactively Assisting Glaucoma Diagnosis with an Expert Knowledge-Distilled Vision Transformer**, focuses on leveraging deep learning to improve clinical decision-making in glaucoma diagnosis. Lastly, **In Search for an Intuitive and Efficient Text-Entry in Mixed Reality: Tap, Gaze & Pinch, SwEYEpe** investigates new methods for text entry in mixed reality environments, aiming to enhance user interaction through intuitive input techniques.


**Overview**: PhysioLabXR is an open-source software platform designed for neuroscience and human-computer interaction (HCI) experiments. It provides a comprehensive environment for real-time, multi-modal physiological data processing and interactive interfaces&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Unlike many existing tools, PhysioLabXR supports various data sources, including EEG, EMG, eye trackers, cameras, and fNIRS, and offers advanced features such as multi-stream visualization and digital signal processing (DSP). Its Python-based scripting interface allows researchers to create custom pipelines, making it a versatile tool for developing closed-loop systems and real-time experiments.



**Key Features**:
