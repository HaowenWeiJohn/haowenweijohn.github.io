## My Journey with Music 🎶

Music has always been a meaningful part of my life. 🎼 I’m especially passionate about the piano—it’s where I feel most at home. 🎹 To me, music is a universal language, capable of expressing emotions and ideas that words sometimes can’t. 🌍

During college, I made it a tradition to perform once a year. Each performance helped me grow as both a musician and a person, deepening my love for the art. 🎤 One composer who’s had a lasting influence on me is Frédéric Chopin. 🎶 His music, filled with emotion and technical beauty, speaks to me in a way that’s hard to put into words. 🎵

I hope you enjoy listening to my music—it means a lot to me to be able to share it with you. 🎧
