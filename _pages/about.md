I hold a double major in Computer Science and Electrical & 
Computer Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 
where I was supervised by [Prof. Erin Solovey](https://users.wpi.edu/~esolovey/) and [Prof. Kaveh Pahlavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveh_Pahlavan).
I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at Columbia University, 
focusing on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Clinical AI, 
under the guidance of [Prof. Steven K. Feiner](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/steven-feiner), [Prof. Paul Sajda](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/faculty/paul-sajda), and [Prof. Kaveri Thakoor](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/profile/kaveri-thakoor-phd).

[//]: # (With a strong foundation in both computer science and electrical engineering, I specialize in pioneering BCI technology. My work integrates advanced physiological data to create real-time, accessible signal processing solutions through machine learning and deep learning techniques. Driven by a passion to bridge gaps and create opportunities, I am dedicated to advancing HCI and biomedical imaging, making cutting-edge technology accessible and impactful for all.)

I specialize in developing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology integrated with VR/AR, using deep learning and signal processing to create accessible innovations. My vision includes helping those with neurodegenerative disorders by designing BCIs that improve daily life, combining technology with a commitment to enhancing well-being. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Harvard Medical School, where I am working on closed-loop neurostimulation.
